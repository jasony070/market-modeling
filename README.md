# Market Modeling

## 1. Background
The goal of this project is to use deep learning to predict the prices/rates of eight financial assets. We use Tensorflow to develop both LSTM and ESN RNN models and compare the models. Then, we use the better model in our web application, which is built on Flask. The web application allows any user to use our model to predict up to eight of the financial assets' prices/rates for however many days and measured using either the prices/rates or growth rates.

## 2. Web application
Our web application is at [Market Modeling](https://market-modeling.herokuapp.com).

### 2.1 Research Report
We have written a short research report on our results here.
